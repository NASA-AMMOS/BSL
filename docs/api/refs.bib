EID Patterns include scheme- specific optimizations for expressing set membership and each scheme pattern includes text and CBOR encoding forms; the pattern for the "ipn" EID scheme being designed to be highly compressible in its CBOR form. This document also defines a Public Key Infrastructure Using X.509 (PKIX) Other Name form to contain an EID Pattern and a handling rule to use a pattern to match an EID.},
